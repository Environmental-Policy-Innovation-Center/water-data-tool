```

The data publisher overwrites files in place at the same S3 keys. The ETL issues an HTTP HEAD request per file, reads the `Last-Modified` header, and imports any files whose timestamp is newer than the last recorded import in the `data_imports` table. No manifest file is needed.

All environments share the same S3 bucket (`tech-team-data`) — it's one bucket, not one per environment. What differs is the folder: `ETL_SOURCE_URL` points at `s3://tech-team-data/national-dw-tool/prod/` for production, or `s3://tech-team-data/national-dw-tool/staging/` for staging, PR preview, and local development (by default). See [DEPLOYMENTS.md](DEPLOYMENTS.md) for the full per-environment breakdown.

## Generic vs. custom importers

Flat CSVs — where each source column is cast and copied straight into one column of a **single model** — are all handled by one class, `Etl::Importers::Generic`. It has no per-file code: its column map (`header → db_column` + `cast`) is derived at runtime from the `source:` blocks in `config/fields.yml` (`FieldRegistry.etl_mapping`). Files that **derive values** (compute, aggregate, parse geometry) or **write to more than one model** keep a custom importer, listed under `custom_imports:` in the manifest. A file is *either* generic (its fields carry `source:` blocks) *or* custom (listed in `custom_imports:`) — never both, enforced by `spec/services/etl/importer_coverage_spec.rb`.

**Nothing is ingested unless it's declared.** Neither importer blindly saves every column in a source file. The generic importer reads only the headers named in `source:` blocks; a custom importer reads only the columns it lists in Ruby. Any other column present in the source file is ignored — never read, never saved. So adding a column to a source file has **no effect** until you declare it (a `source:` block for a generic file, or a line in the custom importer).

**Why one generic importer instead of a class per flat file?**
- The `header → column → cast` mapping already lives in the manifest. A per-file importer would restate it in Ruby — two sources of truth that can drift — for no real gain in traceability, since you'd read the manifest either way.
- It keeps a single, well-tested executor instead of ~8 near-identical classes of casting boilerplate.
- It makes the common change — surfacing a new column from an existing flat file — **config-only**: add a `source:` block, no Ruby.

Custom importers are reserved for loads that genuinely need code. The trade-off: the generic path is all-or-nothing per file — if a flat file later needs even one computed column, that whole file graduates to a custom importer.

## Import Flow

### Step 1: Check freshness via HTTP HEAD

For each file key in `Etl::Importer::FILE_IMPORTERS`, issue an HTTP HEAD request to `ETL_SOURCE_URL/<key><ext>` and read the `Last-Modified` response header.

### Step 2: Compare timestamps

Compare each file's `Last-Modified` against the most recent `imported_at` for that URL in the `data_imports` table. Skip files that haven't changed.

### Step 3: Download and import changed files

For each file that needs updating:

1. Download the file (streamed to disk for large files — see below)
2. Parse (CSV or GeoJSON)
3. Validate row counts and data integrity
4. Upsert into the live table (`ON CONFLICT UPDATE`)
5. Record the import in `data_imports`

**Large file handling**: `epa_sabs_geoms.geojson` is ~1 GB and is handled differently from CSVs. It is streamed to a tempfile via chunked HTTP download (`Net::HTTP` block form), then SAX-parsed one feature at a time using `Oj::Saj`. Features are inserted in 500-record batches and the batch is cleared after each insert, keeping peak memory at O(batch_size) rather than O(file_size). This prevents OOM kills in the 1700 MB container.

### Step 4: Run post-import steps

Importers return `Etl::ImportResult` metadata describing skipped/imported status, changed PWS IDs, changed map layers, geometry changes, previous geometry bounds, and whether a full refresh is required.

If `epa_sabs_geoms.geojson` changed geometry rows, run the derived spatial steps for those systems where possible. See "Post-Import Steps" below.

### Step 5: Refresh affected tiles

See **[TILE_CACHE.md](TILE_CACHE.md)** for the full mechanics — selective refresh (`TileImpact` + `TileCacheRefreshJob`) for normal imports, full bust + `TileCacheWarmJob` as a fallback for explicit full refreshes, which importers actually report `changed_pwsids` (not all of them do), and when a manual bust is required outside of any ETL run entirely.

## Type Casting Rules

The legacy ETL imports everything as TEXT. The new ETL casts at import time via helpers in `Etl::TypeCaster`:


| Helper        | Source columns                                                                                          | DB type          | Behavior                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cast_int`    | Numeric strings (`"42"`, `"1250000"`)                                                                   | `integer`        | `nil` if blank, `nil`/`NULL`, or `"NA"` (case-insensitive)                                                                                               |
| `cast_dec`    | Decimal strings (`"0.85"`, `"12.3"`)                                                                    | `decimal`        | `nil` if blank, `nil`/`NULL`, or `"NA"`                                                                                                                  |
| `cast_score`  | 0-to-1 floats (`a_int_identified_as_disadvantaged`, `pw_int_pop_rpl_themes`, `a_int_overall_cvi_score`) | `decimal` (×100) | `(value.to_f * 100).round(2)`, `nil` if blank or `"NA"`                                                                                                  |
| `cast_bool`   | `"Yes"`/`"No"` or `"Y"`/`"N"` indicators                                                                | `boolean`        | `true` if `Y`/`YES`, `false` otherwise, `nil` if blank                                                                                                   |
| `cast_string` | Free-text / categorical string columns                                                                  | `string`         | Strips whitespace; `nil` if blank or `"NA"`. Real values (`"Territory"`, `"State"`, `"Tribal"`, `"Surface Water"`, `"No"`, etc.) pass through unchanged. |


**"NA" is a missing-value sentinel in the source CSVs** (a common convention in R/pandas pipelines). All five helpers normalize it to `NULL` in the database. No raw `"NA"` strings are stored.

> **Open question — descriptive sentinel strings:** Some CSV columns contain longer explanatory strings instead of `"NA"` for missing data (e.g. `most_common_rate_tidy` uses `"No Information on annual water & sewer rates"`). These are not currently normalized and are stored as-is. Confirm with the EPIC data team whether these strings should be displayed to users or suppressed in favour of a `NULL` / "No data" display.

### Special Cases

`**sdwis_viols.csv**` — this single CSV feeds two models:

- Attribute columns (`gw_sw_code`, `owner_type`, `primacy_type`, etc.) → `public_water_systems`
- Violation count columns → `violations_summaries`
- Boolean indicators (`is_wholesaler_ind`, etc.) use `"Yes"`/`"No"` in the source — cast via `Etl::TypeCaster#cast_bool`

`**pwsid_npdes_usts_rmps_imp.csv**` — has multiple rows per PWS (one per HUC12 watershed). Pre-aggregate with `GROUP BY pwsid, SUM(...)` during import to produce one row per PWS for `watershed_hazards`.

**Environmental justice CSVs** (`cejst.csv`, `ejscreen.csv`, `svi.csv`, `cvi.csv`) — four separate files that all feed into the single `environmental_justices` table. Import each file's columns and merge on `pwsid`.

---

## Post-Import Steps

These run after changed geometries are imported. They generate derived spatial data equivalent to the legacy `post_import_scripts.sql`, but normal runs scope work to changed `pwsid`s where possible.

### 1. Fix invalid geometries

```sql
UPDATE service_area_geometries
SET geom = ST_Buffer(geom, 0)
WHERE ST_IsValid(geom) = false
  AND pwsid = ANY($1::text[]);
```

Run repeatedly until 0 rows are updated. Full refresh fallbacks can run the same repair globally.

### 2. Generate centroids

```sql
UPDATE service_area_geometries
SET centroid = ST_PointOnSurface(geom)
WHERE pwsid = ANY($1::text[]);
```

Uses `ST_PointOnSurface` (not `ST_Centroid`) to guarantee the point falls within the polygon.

### 3. Assign state codes

```sql
UPDATE public_water_systems pws
SET stusps = cs.stusps
FROM service_area_geometries sag
JOIN cartographic_states cs ON ST_Intersects(sag.centroid, cs.geom)
WHERE pws.pwsid = sag.pwsid;
```

Scoped runs also add `AND pws.pwsid = ANY($1::text[])`.

### 4. Build place crosswalks

```sql
DELETE FROM place_system_crosswalks
WHERE pwsid = ANY($1::text[]);

WITH intersections AS (
  SELECT
    cp.geoid,
    sag.pwsid,
    ST_Intersection(sag.geom, cp.geom) AS ix_geom,
    ST_Area(sag.geom) AS sag_area,
    ST_Area(cp.geom) AS place_area
  FROM cartographic_places cp
  JOIN service_area_geometries sag
    ON sag.geom && cp.geom
   AND ST_Intersects(sag.geom, cp.geom)
  WHERE sag.geom IS NOT NULL
    AND sag.pwsid = ANY($1::text[])
)
INSERT INTO place_system_crosswalks
  (geoid, pwsid, fraction_of_service_area, fraction_of_place, created_at, updated_at)
SELECT
  geoid,
  pwsid,
  ST_Area(ix_geom) / NULLIF(sag_area, 0),
  ST_Area(ix_geom) / NULLIF(place_area, 0),
  NOW(), NOW()
FROM intersections
WHERE ST_Area(ix_geom) / NULLIF(sag_area, 0) >= 0.01
   OR ST_Area(ix_geom) / NULLIF(place_area, 0) >= 0.01
ON CONFLICT (geoid, pwsid) DO NOTHING;
```

The method returns affected place geoids so place tiles can be refreshed along with PWS tiles.

### 5. Analyze spatial tables

Normal scoped imports run `ANALYZE service_area_geometries` so the planner sees updated geometry statistics. The full refresh fallback can still rebuild GiST indexes concurrently when a global geometry reload requires it.

---

## Cartographic boundaries (TIGER)

The Census TIGER tables (`cartographic_states/counties/places`) aren't `FILE_IMPORTERS` entries — they're three `.zip` shapefiles under `ETL_SOURCE_URL/cartographic-boundaries/`, loaded by `CartographicBoundaries` via `ogr2ogr`. The importer runs this as a peer step on every cycle:

- **Freshness-gated, per layer** — HEADs each zip and reloads only the layer(s) whose source is newer than the last `cartographic-boundaries` `DataImport` (all layers on first run or when forced). A no-op records no `DataImport`, so an unchanged run does not bump the public "Latest data update" timestamp. The result names the changed boundary layers via `ImportResult#changed_boundary_layers`.
- **Selective boundary refresh** — a changed layer re-runs only its boundary-dependent join (`assign_state_codes` for `states`, `build_place_crosswalks` for `places`; `counties` has no join), then busts and warms **only that layer's tiles** (`bust_cartographic_boundary_tile_cache(layers)` + `TileCacheWarmJob(layers:)`). The pws selective tile cache and the full-refresh path are untouched.
- **Reload on demand** via the `refresh-cartographic-boundaries.yml` workflow. Its `force` input (default on) reloads every layer; unchecking it runs the same freshness gate as the nightly. It then mirrors the nightly's selective refresh — running only the changed layers' joins and busting/warming only their tiles (`PostImportSteps.refresh_boundary_layers`), warming inline since it's a one-off task.

### Tile layers by data source

Which cached tile layers each source feeds — this is why a boundary change and a water-system change touch different (and sometimes overlapping) layers:

| Tile layer | Data source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `states`, `counties` | TIGER only | pure Census boundary shapes |
| `pws`, `pws_low_poly_v1` | EPA SABS only | water-system geometries; `pws_low_poly_v1` is the low-zoom (z<5) pws cache |
| `places` | Both | place *shape* from TIGER + `place_pwsids` (which systems serve it) from the crosswalk (EPA SABS) |

The `places` overlap is why an EPA SABS geometry change reports `changed_layers = [pws, places]` and refreshes the `places` tiles too, not just `pws`.

## Running the ETL

For the full catalog of manual workflows and operational rake tasks, see [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md).

### Manually

```bash
# Full import (all changed files)
bin/rails etl:import

# Single table
bin/rails etl:import[epa_sabs]

# Force re-import (ignore timestamps)
bin/rails etl:import[epa_sabs,force]
```

### Scheduled (SolidQueue)

Configure a recurring job in `config/recurring.yml`:

```yaml
production:
  # Rendered only when ETL_SCHEDULE_ENABLED=true
  etl_import:
    class: EtlImportJob
    queue: etl
    schedule: <%= ENV.fetch("ETL_SCHEDULE", "every day at 12am America/New_York") %>
```

The job runs on the dedicated `etl` queue and has a concurrency limit so imports cannot overlap. It issues HEAD requests per file and only imports files with updated `Last-Modified` timestamps. If a source omits `Last-Modified`, the file imports as changed.

Because ECS services use `RAILS_ENV=production`, recurring ETL is gated by `ETL_SCHEDULE_ENABLED=true` rather than Rails environment alone. Leave the variable unset or false anywhere recurring imports should not run. Set it only on dedicated worker services, and use `ETL_SCHEDULE` to stagger the shared worker pool: staging at 12am America/New_York, production at 1:30am America/New_York, and preview at 3am America/New_York. Preview web services intentionally leave scheduling disabled; the persistent preview worker owns the nightly refresh of the shared preview DB (see `DEPLOYMENTS.md`).

---

## Runtime, Downtime, and Known Issues

### Expected Duration

A full import that includes `epa_sabs_geoms.geojson` (the only file that triggers post-import
geometry steps) runs roughly as follows:

| Step | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Download + SAX-parse + batch insert `epa_sabs_geoms.geojson` (~1 GB) | 15–45 min |
| `CartographicBoundaries.load` — 3 TIGER zips via `ogr2ogr` | 5–15 min |
| `fix_invalid_geometries` + `generate_centroids` | 2–5 min |
| `assign_state_codes` + `build_place_crosswalks` (national spatial joins) | 10–30 min |
| `ANALYZE` on `service_area_geometries` | seconds to minutes |
| **Total** | **~35–105 min** |

CSV-only runs (no geometry change) complete in seconds to a few minutes and do not trigger
the steps above.

### Runtime Behavior During Imports

Imports are designed to keep Puma responsive while data refreshes:

- `EtlImportJob` runs on the dedicated single-thread `etl` queue.
- Tile refresh jobs run on the dedicated single-thread `tile_refresh` queue.
- Tile warm jobs run on the dedicated single-thread `tile_warm` queue.
- Web services use `SOLID_QUEUE_ROLE=web` and exclude `etl`, `tile_refresh`, and `tile_warm`.
- Worker services use `SOLID_QUEUE_ROLE=worker` and process only `etl`, `tile_refresh`, and `tile_warm`.
- Existing cached tiles stay readable during normal selective refreshes.
- Geometry-derived work is scoped to changed systems when import metadata can identify them.
- Full cache bust/warm remains available only for explicit full-refresh fallbacks.

If health checks still fail during a full national geometry refresh, inspect RDS load and the shared worker host. If the worker task cannot place or the full `epa_sabs_geoms` import OOMs, move the shared worker host from `t3.small` to `t3.medium` and increase the worker memory reservation.

## Error Handling


| Scenario                     | Behavior                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S3 unreachable               | Log error, skip import, retry on next scheduled run                          |
| Malformed CSV row            | Log warning with row number and file, skip row, continue import              |
| Invalid geometry             | Logged during post-import repair step; `ST_Buffer(geom, 0)` fixes most cases |
| Import fails mid-transaction | Transaction rolls back — old data remains intact                             |
| Duplicate `pwsid` in source  | Last row wins (UPSERT / `ON CONFLICT UPDATE`)                                |


All import activity is logged with: file URL, row count imported, duration, errors encountered.
